Once an order is placed, users can track their purchases in the My Orders section, ensuring a smooth and transparent delivery process. BiteNow is designed to make food ordering more convenient, efficient, and enjoyable, bringing delicious meals to your doorstep with just a few clicks.
# How we built it
The frontend of Bitenow is built using React.js, with Bootstrap for styling and a responsive user interface. The authentication system is implemented using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user authentication.<br>

The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, incorporating middleware like JWT for token generation and authentication, and CORS to enable seamless communication between the frontend and backend. All user and order-related data is stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB, ensuring efficient and scalable data management.
